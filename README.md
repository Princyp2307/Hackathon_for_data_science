The logistic regression model and random forest model were trained and evaluated.
The accuracy scores and confusion matrices were used to measure the performance.
Feature engineering improved the model accuracy.
**Assumptions and Considerations**
Missing values were filled with median or mode as appropriate.
Outliers were handled by removing extreme values.
New features were created to enhance model performance.
